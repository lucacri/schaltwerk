# Lucode Installation Guide

## Quick Install (Homebrew)

For users with access to the private repository:

```bash
# 1. Add the private Homebrew tap (one-time setup)
brew tap lucacri/tap https://github.com/2mawi2/homebrew-tap

# 2. Install Lucode
brew install --cask lucode

# 3. Launch the application
open -a Lucode
```

## First Launch Setup

Since Lucode is distributed without an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it on first launch. Follow these steps to approve the app:

### Step 1: Attempt First Launch
```bash
lucode
```
You'll see a message that "Lucode" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

### Step 2: Open System Settings
1. Click the Apple menu  > System Settings
2. Navigate to Privacy & Security
3. Scroll down to the Security section

### Step 3: Approve the Application
1. Look for the message: "Lucode was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer"
2. Click the "Open Anyway" button next to this message
3. You may need to enter your password

### Step 4: Confirm Launch
1. Try launching Lucode again
2. A dialog will appear asking if you're sure you want to open it
3. Click "Open"

The application will now launch and work normally. This approval is only needed once.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually or can't use Homebrew:

### Download the Application
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/lucacri/lucode/releases)
2. Download `Lucode-<version>-macos-universal.app.tar.gz`

### Install the Application
```bash
# 1. Extract the archive
tar -xzf Lucode-*-macos-universal.app.tar.gz

# 2. Move to Applications folder
mv Lucode.app /Applications/

# 3. Remove quarantine attribute (optional, helps with Gatekeeper)
xattr -cr /Applications/Lucode.app

# 4. Ad-hoc sign the application (optional, improves security)
codesign --force --deep -s - /Applications/Lucode.app
```

### Launch from Applications
1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to Applications
3. Double-click Lucode
4. Follow the First Launch Setup steps above if blocked

## Troubleshooting

## Automatic Updates

- Lucode checks GitHub releases on startup and installs new versions silently when "Automatic updates" is enabled (default).
- You can toggle this behavior in **Settings → Version** and run a manual check with the "Check for updates" button. Manual checks work even when automatic updates are disabled.
- Updates require internet connectivity and the ability to overwrite the existing `/Applications/Lucode.app`. If macOS prevents the update, reopen the app directly from `/Applications` or reinstall from the latest DMG/tarball.
- After an update is applied you will be prompted with a toast; restart Lucode to launch the new build.

### "Lucode is damaged and can't be opened"
This usually means the quarantine attribute needs to be removed:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Lucode.app
```

### "The application 'Lucode' can't be opened"
Re-sign the application:
```bash
codesign --force --deep -s - /Applications/Lucode.app
```

### App doesn't appear in Applications folder after Homebrew install
Check if it was installed to the Homebrew prefix:
```bash
ls -la $(brew --prefix)/bin/lucode
```

### Terminal permissions issues
If Lucode can't create terminals:
1. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Tools
2. Add Terminal.app or your preferred terminal
3. Restart Lucode

### Port 8547 already in use
Lucode runs an API server on port 8547. If this port is in use:
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8547

# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

## Uninstallation

### Via Homebrew
```bash
brew uninstall lucode
```

### Manual Uninstallation
```bash
# Remove the application
rm -rf /Applications/Lucode.app

# Remove application support files
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/lucode

# Remove logs
rm -rf ~/Library/Logs/lucode
```

## Building from Source

If you need to build Lucode from source:

### Prerequisites
- Bun 1.2 or later (JS tooling)
- Node.js 20 or later (for compatibility and native tooling)
- Rust 1.75 or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools

### Build Steps
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lucacri/lucode.git
cd lucode

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install        # or: npm install

# 3. Build the application
bun run tauri build    # or: npm run tauri build

# 4. The built app will be in:
# src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Lucode.app
```

## Security Considerations

### Why the Security Warning?
Lucode is distributed without an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year) to keep it free and open. The ad-hoc signing we use provides:
- Basic code integrity verification
- Protection against tampering after download
- Consistent behavior across launches

### What Permissions Does Lucode Need?
- **File System Access**: To read and write Para session files
- **Process Spawning**: To create terminal sessions (PTY)
- **Network Access**: Local API server on port 8547
- **No Special Entitlements**: No camera, microphone, or contacts access

### Is It Safe?
- All code is open source and auditable
- No external network connections (only localhost)
- No telemetry or data collection
- Built and signed via GitHub Actions for transparency
